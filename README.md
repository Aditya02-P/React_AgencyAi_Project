AgencyAI - Modern React Showcase
A sleek, high-performance landing page for a fictional AI Agency. This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in modern frontend development, specifically focusing on component-driven architecture, responsive design with Tailwind CSS, and smooth user interactions.

🚀 Overview
The goal of this project was to translate a complex, modern design into a functional React application while maintaining a "bottom-up" approach to component structure. It serves as a visual and technical demonstration of UI/UX implementation without the need for a heavy backend.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Core: React.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first approach)
Icons: Lucide React / React Icons
Animations: Framer Motion (if applicable) or CSS Transitions
Build Tool: Vite

✨ Key Features
Modular Architecture: Every section (Hero, Services, Testimonials, Footer) is built as a reusable React component.
Utility-First Styling: Deep utilization of Tailwind CSS for custom gradients, glassmorphism effects, and precise spacing.
Fully Responsive: Optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile-first layouts to wide-screen desktops.
Interactive Elements: Hover states, smooth scrolling, and optimized asset loading.
